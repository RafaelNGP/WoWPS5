/// What the quality presets mean, for both places that offer them.
///
/// The settings window and the login screen each had their own copy of these
/// numbers, and they had drifted: the same preset named the same thing meant a
/// different picture depending on which one you chose it from. High was 350
/// yards of shadow with 4x MSAA and no FXAA in game, and 250 yards with 2x and
/// FXAA on at the login screen; Medium differed in clutter and multisampling;
/// Low still turned shadows off there after the client stopped honouring that.
///
/// It carries no includes, so the login screen, the settings panel and a test
/// can all read the same rows.

/// What each quality preset means, in the order Low, Medium, High, Ultra.
///
/// That order is what the config file holds. graphics_preset is written as an
/// index - 0 for Custom, then one per row here - so a preset added at the front
/// or in the middle changes what every saved file means, and a player who chose
/// Ultra comes back on High. Add at the end, or migrate the stored value.
///
/// The same is true of the antiAliasing and parallaxQuality columns below: each
/// is an index into a dropdown whose order is also persisted, so a row here can
/// be wrong in two directions at once if either list is reordered. See the note
/// on SettingDesc::choices.
///
/// One row per preset, where there used to be a block per preset - the same
/// ten settings assigned and then pushed at the renderer four times over. The
/// blocks had drifted apart, as four copies of one fact do:
///
///   * Low set a shadow distance of 100 and never told the renderer, so the
///     field said 100 and the shadows stayed at whatever the last preset left.
///   * Only Ultra had an opinion about FXAA. Going from Ultra to Low turned
///     everything else down and left FXAA running.
///   * Low left the normal map strength and parallax quality at whatever they
///     were, which does not matter while both are off and does the moment one
///     is switched back on by hand.
///
/// Reading them as a table is also what lets a preset be recognised again
/// afterwards without writing the numbers out a second time.
