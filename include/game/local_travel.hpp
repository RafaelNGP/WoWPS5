// Local travel network: flight masters, taxi routes and world transports for
// the standalone/LAN realm.
//
// Where the data comes from, and why it is split this way:
//
//  * The route geometry is the player's own client data. TaxiNodes.dbc,
//    TaxiPath.dbc and TaxiPathNode.dbc already ship in every 3.3.5a client and
//    MovementHandler already parses them for online play, so the local realm
//    reuses the same rows rather than inventing a parallel network. Nothing
//    here is fabricated: a route the client does not describe does not exist.
//
//  * Which NPC is a flight master is server data. AzerothCore stores it in
//    creature_template.npcflag, which the catalog importer now carries through
//    as LocalNpcDefinition::npcFlags. When that is missing - the shipped
//    catalog predates the field - the network falls back to proximity: a taxi
//    node is a physical location, and the NPC standing on it is its flight
//    master. That is how the two data sets relate in the first place.
//
//  * Which world transports exist is also server data (gameobject_template
//    type 15 plus its taxi path). The catalog carries it when the user
//    re-imports; otherwise a small built-in table of the classic routes is
//    used. Every built-in entry is validated against the client's own
//    TaxiPath data before it is accepted, so a wrong guess produces no
//    transport rather than a ghost ship on a route that does not exist.
//
// This is a bounded travel simulation, not a claim of retail-identical flight
// paths, prices or schedules.
