/**
 * sun_direction.hpp - which way the sunlight travels at a given hour.
 *
 * Light.dbc and its band tables give a zone its colours and say nothing about
 * where the sun is: the client derives that from the world clock alone, so
 * every zone on a map is lit from the same angle at the same minute and only
 * the colours differ. This is that derivation.
 *
 * It lives here because it was written out twice in lighting_manager.cpp - once
 * for the path that blends real LightParams volumes and once for the fallback
 * used where no volume reaches - and the two copies have to agree exactly. They
 * did, but only by hand: walking out of the last volume's range switches
 * between them mid-stride, and any drift between the two would read as the sun
 * jumping across the sky at a zone edge.
 *
 * The vector points the way the light *travels*, which is away from the sun.
 * That is what every lit shader wants for N-dot-L and what
 * LightingParams::directionalDir has always held; callers that want the
 * direction to the sun - the godray pass, the lens flare - negate it.
 *
 * World space here is the client's: +z is up.

 * The shape of the curve is worth stating, because the constants look
 * arbitrary. The x/z pair sweeps a circle so the sun rises on one side and
 * sets on the other; z is the only component that changes sign, so it alone
 * decides day from night, and the pass that draws sunbeams reads exactly that
 * to know whether there is a sun to scatter. The -0.6 on y is a fixed tilt
 * rather than part of the sweep: it keeps the light coming from slightly
 * behind the world's north the whole day, which is the bias the original
 * client's outdoor shading has and what stops noon from being a light straight
 * down with no shadows in it at all.
